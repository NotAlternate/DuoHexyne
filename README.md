DuoHexyne is a compiler made in the Rust programming language as a fun project. The syntax of DuoHexyne might be hard to follow as it is inspired by both Rust and Haskell.

*Credits to [GameBuilder202](https://github.com/GameBuilder202) as DuoHexyne is mostly [hexagn-rust](https://github.com/GameBuilder202/hexagn-rust)'s compiler*
